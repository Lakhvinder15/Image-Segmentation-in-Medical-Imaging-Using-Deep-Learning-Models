# Image Classification for Brain Tumor Diagnosis Using Deep Learning

## Overview

This project applies deep learning techniques to classify brain MRI images into three categories: **glioma**, **meningioma**, and **tumor**. Originally intended for image segmentation, the task was redefined as a **multi-class image classification problem** due to the absence of segmentation masks. The work demonstrates how artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to support accurate and scalable medical diagnostics.

### üß† Data Preparation
- Dataset: Labeled MRI scans from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/orvile/brain-cancer-mri-dataset)
- Preprocessing: Image resizing (128x128), normalization, and train-test split (80:20)
- Ensured class balance using stratified sampling.

### üß± Model Architecture
- Frameworks: TensorFlow and Keras
- Model: Custom CNN with convolutional, pooling, ReLU, and Softmax layers
- Chosen for efficiency and interpretability over large pre-trained models

### üìà Training & Evaluation
- Trained over 10 epochs
